- 👋 Hi, I’m @JWCTempleton
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a full stack web developer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web design using pure html/css/js as well as leveraging prebuilt technologies such as Bootstrap. 
I'm also getting comfortable working with React and using it to work with API data flows.
- 📫 How to reach me: Please feel free to send me an email at jacob.templeton@gmail.com if you would like to learn more about my skillset.
